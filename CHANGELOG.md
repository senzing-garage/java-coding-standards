## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-30

**Note:** This release closes the longstanding gap that the
bulk-format Python scripts didn't actually format Java code —
only brace placement, javadoc reflow, and short-circuit `if`
rules. A file with mis-indented code or lines longer than 80
characters passed through the orchestrator unchanged, leaving
developers to chase those issues by hand or via VS Code's
built-in formatter (which itself was disabled due to
brace-placement conflicts).

The orchestrator is now a true single-command formatter. Running
`format_file.py path/to/File.java` produces a file that satisfies
`mvn -Pcheckstyle validate`, regardless of caller (CLI, VS Code
runonsave, Claude Code PostToolUse hook, CI pre-commit).

### Added

- `tooling/jdt-formatter/` — small Java CLI shim around the
  Eclipse JDT formatter (`org.eclipse.jdt:org.eclipse.jdt.core
3.42.0`). Reads the existing `tooling/ide/java-formatter.xml`
  profile and formats Java files in place. Source-only — the
  built fat JAR is published as a GitHub Release asset (see
  Release-asset distribution below) and never committed.
- `tooling/scripts/tests/test_format_file_jdt_pipeline.py` — new
  pytest module covering the orchestrator's combined
  JDT-then-scripts behavior, including the user-reported failure
  modes (over-indented brace, long line, bad spacing, missing
  braces around assignment-style if body) and a baseline-excludes
  protection check.
- `tooling/scripts/tests/test_jar_resolution.py` — unit tests for
  the JAR resolution helpers (cache hit, SHA-256 verification,
  download failure cleanup, version parsing).
- `tooling/scripts/tests/fixtures/orchestrator/` — fixture corpus
  for the pipeline tests (byte-comparable input.java/expected.java
  pairs).
- `.github/workflows/release.yaml` — on `v*` tag push, builds the
  JDT formatter JAR, computes its SHA-256, and publishes both as
  attachments on a GitHub Release. Triggered by the maintainer
  cutting a tag; no auto-commit of binaries.

### Changed

- `tooling/scripts/format_file.py` — orchestrator now runs an
  Eclipse JDT formatter pass first (general Java formatting:
  indent, line wrap, continuation-indent, ternary tiers,
  operator-on-continuation, alignment, whitespace), then the
  existing five `fix_*.py` scripts in canonical order
  (overrides: Allman brace placement, javadoc no-orphan reflow,
  short-circuit `if` rules). The five scripts are unchanged in
  behavior; their 190-test corpus is unchanged.
- `tooling/scripts/format_file.py` — JAR resolution: tries (1) a
  local Maven build at `tooling/jdt-formatter/target/jdt-formatter.jar`,
  (2) a cached download, (3) download from the matching GitHub
  Release with SHA-256 verification, (4) a Maven build-from-source
  fallback. Cache directory honors `XDG_CACHE_HOME` and a project-
  specific `SENZING_STANDARDS_CACHE_DIR` env var.
- `adoption/claude-md-templates/vscode-settings-snippet.json` —
  comment block clarifies the rationale for keeping
  `[java].editor.formatOnSave: false`: redhat.java's built-in
  format-on-save would run JDT a second time redundantly with
  emeraldwalk.runonsave invoking the orchestrator. The
  orchestrator runs JDT once internally with the right ordering.
- `.github/workflows/pytest.yaml` — adds a JDK 17 setup step and
  builds `jdt-formatter.jar` from source before invoking pytest,
  populating the local-build resolution path the suite expects.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — Maven `directory` retargeted from
  `/` (no manifest) to `/tooling/jdt-formatter`. Dependabot now
  tracks `org.eclipse.jdt:org.eclipse.jdt.core` with the
  standard 21-day cooldown.

### Removed

- `tooling/jdt-formatter/jdt-formatter.jar` — the previously-
  committed binary. JARs are no longer in git history; they live
  on GitHub Releases. Addresses the supply-chain concern that
  Dependabot bumps were auto-committing opaque (un-reviewable)
  binary content.
- `.github/workflows/rebuild-jdt-formatter-jar.yaml` — no longer
  needed; the JAR isn't committed, so there's nothing to keep in
  sync on a Dependabot PR. The release workflow handles JAR
  publishing on demand.

### Release-asset distribution

The JDT formatter JAR is published as a GitHub Release asset
rather than committed to git. For each `v*` tag:

- `release.yaml` builds the JAR from source under
  `tooling/jdt-formatter/`.
- Computes a SHA-256 digest, written to a `.sha256` sidecar.
- Creates the GitHub Release and attaches both
  `jdt-formatter.jar` and `jdt-formatter.jar.sha256`.

`format_file.py` downloads the JAR (and sidecar) from the release
matching the version pinned in `tooling/jdt-formatter/pom.xml`,
verifies the SHA-256, and caches the result under
`~/.cache/senzing-java-coding-standards/`. Subsequent invocations
are zero-network. Override the cache location with
`SENZING_STANDARDS_CACHE_DIR`; override the release URL base with
`SENZING_STANDARDS_RELEASE_BASE` (for forks or air-gapped mirrors).

Why this matters: a compromised Maven dependency picked up by a
Dependabot bump used to be auto-committed as opaque binary
content with no human review. Now Dependabot bumps update only
`pom.xml` (text, reviewable) and the JAR is rebuilt deterministically
when a maintainer cuts a release tag.

### Migration

Consumer projects bumping their submodule pin to this release
will, on next `format_file.py` invocation:

1. Download the JAR from `https://github.com/senzing-garage/java-coding-standards/releases/download/v0.2.0/jdt-formatter.jar`
   (one-time per machine; cached afterward).
2. Pick up the JDT pass automatically — no further consumer
   action required.
3. Produce a one-time format-compliance diff for any source
   that wasn't previously fully compliant (especially indent,
   line wrap, alignment). Commit as a follow-up "format
   compliance" pass.
4. Subsequent runs are idempotent (verified by the pipeline
   test corpus).

JDK 17+ is required (already required for any consumer's Maven
build). For air-gapped environments, run `mvn package` once in
`tooling/jdt-formatter/` to populate the local build path; the
orchestrator finds it before attempting the download.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-30

**Note:** First substantive release. The `[0.0.0]` entry below was
the senzing-garage repository-creation placeholder; this release
ships the actual standards content, tooling, FAQ server, adoption
playbook, and pytest suite.

### Added

- Initial directory layout: `checkstyle/`, `docs/`, `tooling/`, `mcp/`,
  `adoption/`.
- Canonical `docs/java-coding-standards.md` (912-line standards doc).
- Shared FAQs:
  `building/java-formatting-standards`,
  `building/javadoc-reflow-conventions`,
  `conventions/adding-new-faqs`,
  `testing/system-stubs-and-output-capture`.
- Bulk-format Python scripts in `tooling/scripts/`:
  `fix_allman_braces`, `fix_javadoc_reflow`, `fix_javadoc_inline_tags`,
  `fix_javadoc_tags`, `fix_need_braces`, plus the
  `format_file.py` orchestrator and the shared `_cli.py` helper.
- Generic FAQ MCP server (`mcp/faq_server.py`) with `--server-name`,
  `--faqs-dir`, `--shared-faqs-dir` CLI args and PEP 723 inline
  metadata pinning `mcp==1.27.0`.
- Eclipse JDT formatter profile at `tooling/ide/java-formatter.xml`.
- Adoption playbook: `ADOPTION.md`, `adopt-standards-prompt.md`,
  `slash-commands/init-java.md`, `claude-md-templates/`,
  `verification-checklist.md`.
- `SECURITY.md` documenting the maintained invariants.
- `README.md` with the consumer-adoption quickstart.
- `tooling/scripts/tests/` — pytest suite (190 tests) for the
  bulk-format scripts: per-script fixture-driven cases, helper
  unit tests, idempotency cross-cut, and orchestrator tests.
  43 fixture pairs across the five scripts. Required to pass
  before merge via `.github/workflows/pytest.yaml` (Python
  3.10–3.13 × ubuntu-latest + macos-latest matrix).
- `tooling/scripts/_cli.py` `BASELINE_EXCLUDES` — always-applied
  exclusion patterns covering `tooling/scripts/tests/fixtures/**`
  and `target/**`. Fixtures must stay deliberately non-compliant;
  without these, auto-format hooks running `format_file.py`
  silently rewrite fixture inputs.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Testing" section documenting how to run the
  suite, the test layout, and how to add new fixtures.

### Changed

- `tooling/scripts/_cli.py` `_excluded()` — leading-`**/` patterns
  now also match at path depth zero (gitignore-style approximation),
  so `**/fixtures/**` matches a top-level `fixtures/foo.java`.
- `tooling/scripts/fix_allman_braces.py` — corrected wrong-indent
  Allman split on wrapped control-flow conditions and method
  parameter lists. Replaced the `'(' in stripped` heuristic with a
  paren-balance check, added `find_wrap_opener_indent()` for
  paren-balance walk-back through nested wraps, and added a Case 5
  cleanup pass that re-aligns previously-buggy outputs from older
  script versions.
- `adoption/adopt-standards-prompt.md` — Step 7 (.gitignore) is no
  longer a strict no-op: it adds no new rules but mandates
  `git check-ignore -v` against each created path and `!` exception
  lines for any matches. Step 13 documents that the orchestrator
  smoke test will produce a non-zero diff for projects coming from
  older script vintages, with a second-pass idempotency gate.
- `adoption/claude-md-templates/claude-hooks-snippet.json` — the
  SessionStart freshness fetch uses `git -c http.lowSpeedLimit=1000
http.lowSpeedTime=3 fetch` so it aborts after 3 s in slow or
  unreliable network conditions instead of hanging on a degraded
  connection.
