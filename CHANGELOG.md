## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-30

**Note:** First substantive release. The `[0.0.0]` entry below was
the senzing-garage repository-creation placeholder; this release
ships the actual standards content, tooling, FAQ server, adoption
playbook, and pytest suite.

### Added
- Initial directory layout: `checkstyle/`, `docs/`, `tooling/`, `mcp/`,
  `adoption/`.
- Canonical `docs/java-coding-standards.md` (912-line standards doc).
- Shared FAQs:
  `building/java-formatting-standards`,
  `building/javadoc-reflow-conventions`,
  `conventions/adding-new-faqs`,
  `testing/system-stubs-and-output-capture`.
- Bulk-format Python scripts in `tooling/scripts/`:
  `fix_allman_braces`, `fix_javadoc_reflow`, `fix_javadoc_inline_tags`,
  `fix_javadoc_tags`, `fix_need_braces`, plus the
  `format_file.py` orchestrator and the shared `_cli.py` helper.
- Generic FAQ MCP server (`mcp/faq_server.py`) with `--server-name`,
  `--faqs-dir`, `--shared-faqs-dir` CLI args and PEP 723 inline
  metadata pinning `mcp==1.27.0`.
- Eclipse JDT formatter profile at `tooling/ide/java-formatter.xml`.
- Adoption playbook: `ADOPTION.md`, `adopt-standards-prompt.md`,
  `slash-commands/init-java.md`, `claude-md-templates/`,
  `verification-checklist.md`.
- `SECURITY.md` documenting the maintained invariants.
- `README.md` with the consumer-adoption quickstart.
- `tooling/scripts/tests/` — pytest suite (190 tests) for the bulk-
  format scripts: per-script fixture-driven cases, helper unit
  tests, idempotency cross-cut, and orchestrator tests. 43 fixture
  pairs across the five scripts. Required to pass before merge via
  `.github/workflows/pytest.yaml` (Python 3.10–3.13 × ubuntu-latest
  + macos-latest matrix).
- `tooling/scripts/_cli.py` `BASELINE_EXCLUDES` — always-applied
  exclusion patterns covering `tooling/scripts/tests/fixtures/**`
  and `target/**`. Fixtures must stay deliberately non-compliant;
  without these, auto-format hooks running `format_file.py`
  silently rewrite fixture inputs.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Testing" section documenting how to run the
  suite, the test layout, and how to add new fixtures.

### Changed

- `tooling/scripts/_cli.py` `_excluded()` — leading-`**/` patterns
  now also match at path depth zero (gitignore-style approximation),
  so `**/fixtures/**` matches a top-level `fixtures/foo.java`.
- `tooling/scripts/fix_allman_braces.py` — corrected wrong-indent
  Allman split on wrapped control-flow conditions and method
  parameter lists. Replaced the `'(' in stripped` heuristic with a
  paren-balance check, added `find_wrap_opener_indent()` for
  paren-balance walk-back through nested wraps, and added a Case 5
  cleanup pass that re-aligns previously-buggy outputs from older
  script versions.
- `adoption/adopt-standards-prompt.md` — Step 7 (.gitignore) is no
  longer a strict no-op: it adds no new rules but mandates
  `git check-ignore -v` against each created path and `!` exception
  lines for any matches. Step 13 documents that the orchestrator
  smoke test will produce a non-zero diff for projects coming from
  older script vintages, with a second-pass idempotency gate.
- `adoption/claude-md-templates/claude-hooks-snippet.json` — the
  SessionStart freshness fetch uses `git -c http.lowSpeedLimit=1000
  http.lowSpeedTime=3 fetch` so it aborts after 3 s in slow or
  unreliable network conditions instead of hanging on a degraded
  connection.
